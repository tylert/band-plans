// Footnotes:
// (1) Digital Channeling 25 kHz "minimum" raster, contiguous multiples of 25 kHz should be released based on required Digital System Bandwidth. (Data Rate and Modulation scheme will govern bandwidth). Consult with your local coordinating body, or RAC where no coordination exists.
// (2) Once communications has been established, QSY off frequency to allow others to call.
// (3) ATV operations may be for point to point, or repeater input operations. Note that any non ATV activity below 444.0 MHz must be coordinated with ATV users to minimize or eliminate interference to the video signal. Consult with RAC for advice on administrative and technical means to achieve this. Note that Double Sideband Video is NOT sanctioned from a technical, spectrum, interference and power conservation viewpoint. Note that non video Digital operations in this sub-band should only occur if other frequencies allocated are full, consult with your local coordination body. RAC supports development of spectrally efficient video transmission techniques in this band.
// (4) Local Option - consult with your local coordinating body.
// (5) Repeaters - includes Narrowband FM, Digital (Voice, video and data) modes. Frequencies must be coordinated with your local coordinating body, or RAC VHF-UHF Advisory where no coordination body exists.
// (6) Non conforming analog links on 70 cm are grandfathered provided that their existence does not cause harmful interference with amateur operations designated for that sub-band. In the case of interference, coordination discussions must be held to resolve the problem. Note grandfathering ceases once that link goes out of service, consult with your local coordinating body.
// (7) Digital operations may include repeater operation, crossband duplex operation, links or simplex. Consult with your local coordination body.
// (8) RAC encourages development of Digital compression techniques to reduce video bandwidth within this sub-band.
// (9) Spread Spectrum centre frequency, secondary, operations per IC bandwidth limit of 12 MHz (max. spreading), may occur within these sub-bands, but must not cause interference to primary Amateur systems.
// (10) Propagation Beacon frequencies are to be coordinated through the RAC VHF UHF Advisory Committee.
// (11) RAC encourages the use of CTSS encoding where spectral congestion occurs.
