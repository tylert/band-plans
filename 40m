GENERAL NOTES:
• Where Notes are shown, these activities have priority over other activities.
• During major weekend Contest activities, activity in certain modes can spill over into other
segments.
• Sideband Usage Below 10MHz use lower sideband (LSB)
• Phone modes should not operate closer than 3000Hz to the lower segment edge.
• Wide band digital refers to any digital mode using more than 500Hz bandwidth.
• Narrow band digital modes: All modes using up to 500Hz bandwidth.
• Image modes: Any analogue or digital image using bandwidth up to 2700Hz.
